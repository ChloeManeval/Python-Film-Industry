## Motivation and Objectives of the Project 

### Motivation:
An explorative project, focusing on the global film industry between 1985 and 2019, at the request of a small German film production company who wants to expand onto the global market. The client wants to understand the trends in the global film industry in order to incorporate data driven insights in their decision-making process when greenlighting projects.

### Objective:
Create a storyboard providing information about the top 200 movies released each year between 1985 and 2019.
It will be used by the stakeholders when defining their global editorial line and by the production team when evaluating individual projects and their potential.
