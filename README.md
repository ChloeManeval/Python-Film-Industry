# Python-Film-Industry
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks I used during my student project about the Global Film Industry between 1985 and 2019.

# Global Film Industry Analysis Project
## Tools used for this project:
* Python/Anaconda/Jupyter
* Microsoft Excel
* Tableau Public
## Structure of the data set
* 1 data set, made available by by Daniel Grijalva, a Kaggle user who scraped the data from the IMDb website. The owner of the data is therefore Daniel Grijalva, who created the data set and made it available for use online, under the CC0 1.0 Universal license. The data sets can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies).
* Size of the final data set: 7000 rows, 14 columns.
* 1 GeoJSON file, which can be accessed [here](https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries/r/0.html). The data is licensed under the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License. Note that the original data has been made available thank to  Natural Earth, Lexman and the Open Knowledge Foundation. All source code is licenced under the MIT licence.

## Motivation and Objectives of the Project 

### Motivation:
An explorative project, focusing on the global film industry between 1985 and 2019, at the request of a small German film production company who wants to expand onto the global market. The client wants to understand the trends in the global film industry in order to incorporate data driven insights in their decision-making process when greenlighting projects.

### Objective:
Create a storyboard providing information about the top 200 movies released each year between 1985 and 2019.
It will be used by the stakeholders when defining their global editorial line and by the production team when evaluating individual projects and their potential.
